The Java TCP Chat Application is a simple but effective implementation of a real-time communication system between a client and a server using Java's networking capabilities. It makes use of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to ensure reliable communication and Java multithreading to enable simultaneous sending and receiving of messages. This program serves as a practical example of how client-server communication works over a network and is an ideal solution for demonstrating a multithreaded chat system.
The application consists of two separate Java programs: one for the server and another for the client. The server waits for incoming client connections on a specific port, while the client connects to that port to begin communication. Once the connection is established, both the client and server can send and receive messages simultaneously. This is made possible using two separate threads in each program: one for reading incoming messages and another for sending messages.
On the server side, the program begins by creating a ServerSocket that listens on port 5000. When a client attempts to connect, the server accepts the connection using the accept() method, which returns a Socket object representing the connection to the client. To manage communication effectively, the server then starts two threads. One thread continuously reads messages from the client through an input stream, and the other thread reads messages from the serverâ€™s console and sends them to the client through an output stream. This allows the server to read and write independently, enabling full-duplex communication.
Similarly, the client application creates a Socket object that connects to the server on port 5000. Upon successful connection, the client also launches two threads: one for receiving messages from the server and another for sending messages typed by the user. These threads use Java's BufferedReader and PrintWriter classes to handle the reading and writing of messages through the socket's input and output streams.
The use of multithreading in both programs is crucial. Without threads, either the read or write operation would block the other, resulting in an inefficient and non-interactive experience. With threads, the program remains responsive and provides a seamless chat experience.
This project fulfills the key requirements of the assigned internship task, which includes creating a functional client-server chat application using Java sockets and handling multiple users through multithreading. Although the current implementation demonstrates communication between one server and one client, the design is flexible and can be extended to support multiple clients. This can be achieved by maintaining a list of connected clients on the server and broadcasting messages to all of them.
In conclusion, the TCP Chat Application provides a clear understanding of how network communication, socket programming, and multithreading work together to build a real-time system. It serves as a strong foundation for developing more complex systems such as multi-user chat servers, messaging applications, and collaborative platforms. The modular structure of the code also makes it easy to enhance with features such as user authentication, private messaging, GUI interfaces, and message logging for future development.
